  <h5>Why does Jem want to go back to get his pants? What does his reason tell 
    you about his relationship with his father? Cite a specific quote to support 
    your answer. </h5>
  <p>The reason that Jem is determined to retrieve his pants from the Radley’s 
    yard was because he did not want to disappoint his father. Atticus upholds 
    strong beliefs and morals and due to Jem’s age, he is expected to follow 
    and adhere to them - Jem did not want to hurt Atticus’s feelings. The quote 
    “I don’t want to hear of poker in any form again. Go by Dill’s and get your 
    pants, Jem. Settle it yourselves” backs this up as it highlights the strict 
    relationship that Jem has with his father.
